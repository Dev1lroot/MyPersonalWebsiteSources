<p><strong>1. Democracy is not a value.</strong><br>
It is not an ideal, not a virtue, not a moral compass. It is a cold mechanism for counting heads - nothing more. To worship it as something higher is delusion.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>2. Democracy does not guarantee prosperity.</strong><br>
History is full of "democratic" ruins, bankrupt states, and societies rotting in apathy. Votes do not build wealth. Ballots do not feed the hungry. Procedures do not save lives.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>3. Democracy is legalized violence.</strong><br>
Every state rules by force. Democracy only baptizes this force with the will of the majority. Violence branded as "lawful" is still violence - brutal, merciless, and often blind.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>4. Democracy is the tyranny of the majority.</strong><br>
The mob decides, and its will becomes absolute. Minorities can be crushed, erased, annihilated - and the system still calls itself "just." In truth, it is nothing but sanctioned oppression.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>5. Democracy is not compassion.</strong><br>
Rights and dignity are trampled the moment they stand in the way of numbers. Without institutions and values stronger than votes, democracy degenerates into cruelty, where the weak exist only at the mercy of the crowd.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>6. Democracy expands oppression endlessly.</strong><br>
Imagine a fire lit by the crowd. At first, only branches burn - the "obvious enemies." Then books and thoughts are thrown in, because silence must be kept. Soon, people themselves are fed to the flames - strangers, then dissenters, then those who simply stood apart. Each step feels justified, each expansion inevitable. The majority always demands a new victim, until nothing remains but fire itself.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong><br>
Democracy is not sacred. It is not justice, not freedom, not safety. It can liberate or massacre, uplift or devour. The true measure of society lies not in ballots, but in its humanity - in its will to protect every person, even against the frenzy of the majority.</p>
